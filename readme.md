# Default icons collection used by Iconify API

SimpleSVG project has been renamed to Iconify.design and this repository has moved. This repository is archived and no longer updated.

New location is https://github.com/iconify-design/collections-json

Unlike old repository that was used as dependency from GitHub, new repository is available on both NPM and Packagist. It is updated daily (unless there is nothing to update), so all collections are always up to date. See instructions in readme.md at new repository location: https://github.com/iconify-design/collections-json/blob/master/readme.md
